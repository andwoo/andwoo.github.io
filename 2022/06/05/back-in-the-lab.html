    <h1>Back In The Lab</h1>
    <div class="mb-4">05 Jun 2022</div>
    <p>Last year I was looking through a collection of Gameboy games at my local game store and found a copy of Kirby Tilt ‘n’ Tumble. This game fascinates me because it has a built in accelerometer and tilting your Gameboy moved Kirby around on the screen.</p>

<p>Right beside Kirby was Dexter’s Lab. I love the show and thought why not pick it up too but as soon as I got home I immediately forgot about Dexter and focused on how cool accelerometers are.</p>

<p>A few days go by and I finally circle back to Dexter but sadly the game wouldn’t boot up. It would sit at the splash screen with a missing or garbled Nintendo logo. Cleaning the contacts would exbibit same issue but I wasn’t completely disappointed because I thought this could become a future fixing project.</p>

<p>Many months go by and I stumble on the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg21VeFM-_Y">I Bought 5 Broken GAMEBOY Games on eBay - How Many Can I FIX?!</a> and out of curiosity I watch. Thinking some advance techniques or high difficulty fixes had to be performed, I was surprised by how simple the fix was for most of the games. Simply put, the rom chips no longer had solid connections. Thinking I had nothing to lose I opened up Dexter’s Lab and re-flowed the joints.</p>

<p>Oh my goodness it worked.</p>

<p>I was so happy when the music started playing and surprised the fix worked. I wonder how many Gameboy Color games out there have this problem and end up in the garbage. The thought makes me sad but if I ever find more broken games out there, I’m picking them up.</p>
