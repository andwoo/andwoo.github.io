Over the past year I've done a lot of modding projects and it's finally time to summarize everything. My original plan was to write a blog post for each project over the year but that clearly didn't happen so here's everything all at once.

<br>

I built a Gameboy Advance SP [Slate](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/makho/products/slate-by-makho).

Added the [Retro Gem](https://www.pixelfx.co/product-page/retro-gem-universal-hdmi-upscaler-kit) HDMI kit from PixelFX to not one but three Nintendo 64s and upgraded all of them with a region free cartridge tray.

Built my dream Super Nintendo with all new capacitors and a [transparent shell](https://retrogamerestore.com/store/snes_shell/).

Struggled to add hard drive capabilities to a PS2 slim. It worked for a couple weeks until it stopped. In the end I removed the custom flex cable and instead added game ISO loading from an external Raspberry Pi. The [Retro Gem](https://www.pixelfx.co/product-page/retro-gem-universal-hdmi-upscaler-kit) HDMI kit from PixelFX was also added to the console.

I splurged and bought and modified a Japanese spice orange Gamecube. It contains all the previous mods I did in my original Gamecube post but this time with the hardware revision 2 of the [GCLoader](https://www.black-dog.tech/gc-loader-pnp-1.html).

Finally my latest console modification. I wasn't happy with how the PS2 Slim turned out because it required a Raspberry Pi to function and it wasn't ideal to turn it off through ssh each time I shutdown the console. My solution was to get the original larger version of the PS2 containing built in hard drive support. Like all my HDMI upgraded consoles, I yet again added the [Retro Gem](https://www.pixelfx.co/product-page/retro-gem-universal-hdmi-upscaler-kit) kit along with all new capacitors, thermal pads and an upgraded network adapter so I can use a 2.5 inch SSD.
