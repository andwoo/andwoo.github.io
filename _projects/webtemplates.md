I created a collection of template repositories to quickly get my ideas off the ground. My biggest hurdle when starting a new personal web project is the repetitive start up boilerplate. Doing the same thing over and over got tiring and occasionally I would give up on an idea because of the set up time it takes to configure a modern web project. Starter projects exist out there but with so many dependencies I sometimes couldn't tell what their use was. These starters tried to cast a wide net to cover many project types. I wanted something minimalist.

I decided to put some time aside and create my own series of starter project targeting different use cases. I started from the ground up and this time I knew what each dependency was used for. Not only is it easy for me to get an idea off the ground, but I have learned a lot from both configuring and maintaining these templates.

### Update
Unfortunately I've stopped maintaining these repositories because it's been some time since I've used them. The primary reason is I'm really like the Ember framework and my newer side projects have been using that technology.
