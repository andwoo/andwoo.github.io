A match 3 game where gameplay involves meeting objectives by matching tiles in different formations. My contributions to the project were the following:
- Dynamic store front including in app purchasing.
- Integration with Facebook.
- Client SDK to communicate with the Magmic in-house servers. The SDK was used across multiple projects.
- Leaderboards.
- Content download system.
