Every time I launch my browser, I open several tabs to catch up on what's new on my favourite sites. I decided to make a web browser extension to showcase all the information I wanted to see on one page. The page contains a list of quick launch icons, followed live Twitch streamers, favourite subreddits and upcoming esports matches.
