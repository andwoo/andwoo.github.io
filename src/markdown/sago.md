During my time at Karman Interactive I worked with the Toronto based kids learning company [Sago Mini](https://sagomini.com/en/). My primary role was to augment their existing Unity team working on [Sago Mini World](https://sagomini.com/en/sagominiworld/). The application acts as a hub for all their standalone games along with user session management and subscription purchasing. I was eventually tasked with creating a new game to add to Sago Mini World titled Magic Camera with the end goal of adding augmented reality capabilities to their physical playset toy [Jinja's House](https://sagomini.com/en/toys/detail/portable-playset-jinja-s-house/).

## Magic Camera

The application is used in tandem with a physical playset and using the power of augmented reality the playset came to life. To accomplish this, we detected special areas of interest on the playset and overlaid animations on top giving new replay value. The app was a huge success and was featured as part of the iOS 12.0 AR launch and the physical playset is now sold in Apple Stores.
