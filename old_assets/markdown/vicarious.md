Vicarious VR is a San Francisco based company where I led a remote team of 3 developers. The application is a social media platform supporting 360 image and video sharing with virtual reality capabilities. The application, targeting iOS and Android, allowed users to upload and share 360 media viewable in either 2D or virtual reality using the Google Daydream and Cardboard headsets.
